Mirzapur fans, get ready for an exciting surprise! If you thought Season 3 was over, think again. Divyenndu Sharma, who plays the popular character Munna Tripathi (also known as Munna Bhaiya), is returning to the Prime Video series. A special bonus episode is releasing today, August 30th. The makers of the show shared the news through a promo video on Instagram, with the caption, "Bawaal hone wala hai, kyunki bonus episode aa raha hai" (Get ready for some chaos, because a bonus episode is coming).



In the promo clip, Divyenndu says, "Hum kya gaye, pura bawaal mach gaya. Suna hai humare loyal fans bohut miss kiye humko. Season 3 me kuch cheezein miss kiye aap. Wo hum khoj ke le aaye hain, just for you, Munna Tripathi ke suajanya se" (Ever since I left, there has been chaos. I’ve heard our loyal fans missed me a lot. You missed out on some things in Season 3, so I've brought them back for you, thanks to Munna Tripathi’s intelligence).



Fans of the show will remember that Munna Tripathi entertained everyone in Seasons 1 and 2. However, he was missing from Season 3 because his character was killed by Guddu Bhaiyya (played by Ali Fazal) at the end of Season 2.



In an interview with NDTV's Abira Dhar, Divyenndu Sharma shared an interesting story from his time filming in Scotland. He talked about a fan from Brazil who was so excited to see him that she called her sister on a video call, saying, "It’s him!" Mirzapur has truly become popular worldwide, breaking barriers of age, location, and culture.
